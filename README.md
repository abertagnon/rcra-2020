This repository contains datasets related to the paper: *Improving the efficiency of Euclidean TSP solving in Constraint Programming by predicting effective nocrossing constraints* (Elena Bellodi, Alessandro Bertagnon, Marco Gavanelli, Riccardo Zese) submitted at the *27th RCRA International Workshop on Experimental Evaluation of Algorithms for Solving Problems with Combinatorial Explosion*.

* The `ml-instances` directory contains 1024 Euclidean TSP instances, generated in 2 classes (uniform and clustered) using the generator of the DIMACS challenge ([8th DIMACS Implementation Challenge: The Traveling Salesman Problem](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/archive/Challenges/TSP/)). Each instance is provided in TSPLIB format (.tsp) and in a Prolog-like syntax (.pl). **All these instances have been solved and the collected runtime data have been used to build the `ml-dataset` used to train the Random Forest (RF) classifier**.

* The `etsp-solver-instances` directory contains 1024 Euclidean TSP instances (different from the ones above), generated in 2 classes (uniform and clustered) using the generator of the DIMACS challenge ([8th DIMACS Implementation Challenge: The Traveling Salesman Problem](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/archive/Challenges/TSP/)). Each instance is provided in TSPLIB format (.tsp) and in a Prolog-like syntax (.pl). Each `.arff` (Attribute Relationship File Format) file contains the features of each constraint ready to be used for classification with Weka workbench for machine learning ([Weka]( https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)). Each `.pl` file also contains Prolog facts in the form: `nocross(A,B)` that indicate the pairs of nodes on which the nocrossing constraint should be imposed according to the Random Forest (RF) classifier prediction.
